# S32K312 Communication Project

This repository contains a project implemented using the S32K312 microcontroller and developed with S32 Design Studio (S32DS) by NXP. The project demonstrates communication between devices using CAN, verifies uaing UART and timing control managed by the Periodic Interrupt Timer (PIT).

## Overview

The project showcases the integration of various hardware peripherals and modules provided by the S32K312 microcontroller. It primarily focuses on:

- **UART Communication**: Implementing bi-directional data transfer between devices using UART protocols.
- **Periodic Interrupt Timer (PIT)**: Utilizing PIT for precise timing and event triggering within the application.
- **FlexCAN Module**: Facilitating communication over a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, demonstrating message transmission and reception capabilities.

## Features

### UART Communication
The project utilizes UART for reliable and efficient communication between connected devices. It includes:
- Initialization and configuration of UART interfaces.
- Sending and receiving data packets asynchronously.
- Handling UART communication errors and timeouts.

### Periodic Interrupt Timer (PIT)
PIT is employed to manage critical timing intervals essential for the application's functionality:
- Configuring PIT channels for specific time intervals.
- Triggering events and updating application states based on PIT interrupts.
- Ensuring precise timing synchronization between communicating devices.

### FlexCAN Integration
The project integrates the FlexCAN module for CAN communication, enabling seamless data exchange over a CAN bus:
- Initializing and configuring FlexCAN peripherals.
- Transmitting and receiving CAN messages using standard identifiers.
- Handling CAN message reception and updating application states accordingly.
